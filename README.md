## Building

### Preparation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/ChaosModV.git`

2. `cd ChaosModV`

3. Initialize all submodules

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

## Building

Check the corresponding subdirectories for instructions on how to compile each project.
	
## Adding new effects

You can easily add and share your own effects using the integrated Lua scripting engine. See [here](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/ChaosModV/wiki/Lua-Scripting) for more information.

Otherwise, if you want to integrate your effect directly into the mod:

1. Create a new .cpp file in the appropriate folder under `ChaosMod/Effects/db/` with a fitting name

Layout of the file should look like this:

```cpp
/*
	Effect by <Your Name>
*/

#include <stdafx.h>

static void OnStart()
{
	
}

static void OnStop()
{
	
}

static void OnTick()
{
	
}

// clang-format off
REGISTER_EFFECT(OnStart, OnStop, OnTick, EffectInfo
	{
		// These are always required, you may have to add more designators depending on your effect
		.Name = "Generic Effect",
		.Id = "player_funny_stuff"
	}
);
```

The project makes use of clang-format which will mess up the formatting of the list-initialization, thus it's necessary to exempt it using `// clang-format off`.

2. Add the same info to `ConfigApp/Effects.cs`
